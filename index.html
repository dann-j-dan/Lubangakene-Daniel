      <p>Hello! My name is Lubangakene Daniel and I am from Lira City in Uganda. I am really into video gamings and sports
        more esspecially football and I love computers so much that even brough me up to its courses so that I could have more 
        knowledge and experience through learning it and be perfect in it as per I get a good job to sustain my life. I live with 
        my mother and my deaf and dump brother Milton and in our family we're many in numbers but our father's residence is far from
        us abit though we live together as a family. We are all members of the church of The Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints Adyel Branch 
        in Lira city. I have not served mission but I Strive hard to live by the gospel principles of Jesus christ and follow his examples as
        per our prophet seer and revealator teaches us to do so and any other apostles and church leaders around the world.
